Emergency Funds
What is it?

Simply put, it's money stowed away for emergency use.

What kind of emergencies?

Emergencies are the ones you are not expecting to happen but need immediate attention. This does not include Flash Lazada Sales, Piso Fares, and expenses that you should have been saving for in the first place before it is due (e.g. kid's tuition, Meralco, wedding).

Why do I need it?

Any good financial book or advisor would always tell you that when you start investing the very first thing* you need to do is to build up your emergency fund. This is because having a buffer for unexpected events in your life frees you from debt, worry and ensures that you could follow your financial plans to a T.

I'm ready, how much should I save? Is there a magic number?

The amount you need to put away is a case to case basis. Some save from 3 months' worth of salary, others could do 6 or even for a whole year. The premise is that if you find yourself jobless for x months you don't need to depend on anybody's charity to get by. Just be realistic on your planned amount and time frame and you're good to go.

Don't forget to replenish each time you use it too. Always make it a point that your fund is intact as soon as you can.

I now have the money, where should I put it?

The safest place you could put it is in the bank. It's free and unlike your closet earns a bit of interest. Just put an effort in not withdrawing anything from it and that would be fine.

You can also put it in a low risk 30 Day recurring Time Deposit. Not only does it have better interest rates, it prevents you to withdraw because it is locked for 30 days. You can get it anytime though (this is for emergency after all) but you need to personally meet a bank rep just to transact unlike with an ATM that you only need to dip it on a machine.

But it's a huge amount, shouldn't I invest it instead?

This is a big NO. Emergency funds need to retain their principal amount to be of any value. There is no point in putting it on high risk investments. This is like gambling with your child's college fund hoping that it would double before you need it.

*Technically you need to pay off debts first, especially short ones and with high interest.

Alternative places where to place your emergency fund

Savings accounts that give you free insurance (BPI Save-up/ BPI Pamana/ Security Bank All Access/ BDO Kabayan/ RCBC Hexagon Club Privilege)
Money market funds (Look at asset type = money market in this list)
High-interest savings accounts (ING/ CIMB)
Combination of 1, 2, 3
Please consider the convenience and time needed to withdraw from your emergency fund when actual emergencies happen. So you may structure your emergency fund depending on how long it takes to withdraw them. An example would be:

2 days worth of expenses to be kept at home
2 weeks worth of expenses to be kept in an ATM savings account
3 to 5.5 months worth of expenses to be kept in a money market fund
This is just an example. You need to plan for it basing on your personal situation.

Before investing, know yourself first (goals, investment horizon, risk appetite)!
Go back to FAQ main page

Before investing, know yourself first (goals, investment horizon, risk appetite)!
Determine your short-term and long-term goals. Financial independence is a lofty goal but not impossible.

Determine your investment horizon. 1 year, 5 years, 20 years, 40 years?

Determine your risk appetite. How much percent loss woud you be able to stomach? 1%, 5%, 20%, 50%?

Build your emergency fund worth 3 to 6 months of your expenses. This is important because you don't want to be forced to sell your investments at a loss because you need to raise money for an emergency. The emergency fund should be used only for emergencies.

Invest in yourself. Keep on learning. Keep on finding ways to increase your cash flow. It's easier to invest if you have money to invest.

Check this flowchart if you need insurance.

Basing on #1, #2, and #3, pick a suitable investment. Some options are money market funds, bond funds, equity funds. You may refer to u/treeperfume's spreadsheet on the sidebar for the historical performance of different funds. High returns would also have high risk. If your investment horizon is long term (> 10 years) and if you can stomach a 30% loss, I would advise to invest in an equity index fund. The best index fund would be FMETF since it has the lowest management fees among equity index funds (0.5%). Other investment options can be found here, and here (passive) and here (mp2).

If you decide to do index investing, consider using the peso cost averaging method.

If your goal is financial independence, you can calculate your target net worth simply by dividing your target annual expenses by the SWR (safe withdrawal rate). The rule of thumb is 4%. At 80k monthly expenses or 960k per year, you need a net worth of 24M. At 2.8% SWR, you need 34M. A bit high for many, but certainly not impossible. You may also use this FIRE calculator that considers inflation and increasing and non-recurring expenses.

TL/DR: Know yourself. Get an emergency fund. Continue to improve your cashflow. Keep on learning. Beware of VULs. Pick suitable investments basing on your goals, investment horizon and risk appetite. If equity index funds suits you, buy FMETF monthly and hold for the long term. Strive to achieve financial independence. Retire early if that's what you prefer.

Modified Pag-IBIG 2 (MP2)
A savings program launched by the government in 2010 as an additional alternative for Pinoys to grow their money. The fund is used in various government programs, majority of it to finance housing loans.

Jump to ADVANTAGES | See HISTORICAL RATES
​

Basic Info
​

Pre-requisite
an active Pag-IBIG member or retiree/former member with atleast 24 mos of P1 savings.
for voluntary members like students with part-time job, see this comment.
Lock-in period
5 years - which will start by the time you make your first deposit, not when you generated the MP2 number from their website.
Registration
Upon application you can choose to receive annual dividends OR have your investment compounded which will generate more gain.
Online enrollment only takes a minute or two (prepare your MID#) and disregard the "pass this to the branch" stated in the form. You only pass that if the employer agree to a salary deduction monthly set-up. Which on most cases, they don't since mp2 is a personal transaction unlike P1 which is mandatory. What you need on that form is only the MP2# for your deposits.
Payment
Pay anytime - may it be twice a month, quarterly, one-time lump deposit, etc.
Minimum deposit amount per transaction is P500. For deposits of P500,000 and above, a personal/managers check is needed to remit the amount.
Deposits can be done remotely through GCash with P5 fee OR via any other bills payment facility. It is advisable to remit your MP2 contributions personally, as your HR can confuse it as your P1 voluntary contribution.
Dividends
MP2 dividend rate is always higher than P1 rate by 0.50%.
Dividend rate is announced end of 1st quarter of the following year, usually around March.
The dividend computation for the 5th and final year will use the latest available div rate.
Pay-out
Annual dividends can be paid out through the Loyalty Card Plus
Upon maturity, proceeds can be deposited via DBP, Landbank account or the Loyalty Card Plus (if you have any). If none, a cheque will be issued. Having a card will therefore save you another branch visit after confirmation text is received that your withdrawal money is ready.
Multiple Accounts
Multiple MP2 account opening is allowed, depending on your current/future goal, a strategy plan can be utilized for this to work in your favor (shoutout to Angkol for the 3 hacks/strat below)
Annual dividend harvesting for retirement phase purposes
Roll-over to new MP2 accounts after every 5-year maturity for wealth accumulation, taking advantage of the compounding set-up
Ladderized account opening to pay for anticipated big expenses like college tuition year on year, also on compounding set-up
​

Monitoring
Deposit history can be viewed:

1) via online by creating a Virtual Pag-IBIG account

a) using the Loyalty Card Plus

b) by visiting a Pag-IBIG branch

c) by setting-up a video call for OFWs

2) OR via email by requesting the MP2 ESAV (Employee's Statement of Accumulated Value)

​

PROS
Principal is guaranteed by the government
Interest earned is tax-free
No maximum investment limit
No management fees
​

CON
Redemption - once your MP2 fund matures 5 years later, you may apply online for claim OR personally visit any Pag-IBIG office to file a claim for withdrawing your capital and/or dividends. Processing time can take upto 20 days.

No need to login for online application. Just go to Virtual Pag-IBIG > Claim Pag-IBIG Savings > MP2 Savings Maturity ("Check Status Of Claims" is also available after successful application)

For Pag-IBIG branch withdrawal, the form can be downloaded online and filled up prior to visiting the office.

I was able to withdraw mine after 7 business days via online application. Actual process time is only 1 day, most of the waiting is for Pag-IBIG to hand-over the application to the right branch. I knew this because that's when the online status got updates and someone from local branch contacts me clarifying an issue with my ID selfie (morning time), then my MP2 proceed was deposited to my LCP account by night time. This is as of Q3 of 2023, the turn-around time will improve as time passes. Note that from my experience, I did not receive any confirmation text that my fund is already available nor did the status on the online claim indicated as 'complete'. Check your online banking for real-time update. As for your MP2 details at Virtual Pag-IBIG, everything will be retained except that the accumulated value will zero-out after withdrawal.
​

Historical MP2 Rate
Year	Div Rate	Year	Div Rate	Year	Div Rate
2025		2020	6.12%	2015	5.34%
2024		2019	7.23%	2014	4.69%
2023	-	2018	7.41%	2013	4.58%
2022	7.03%	2017	8.11%	2012	4.67%
2021	6.00%	2016	7.43%	2011	4.63%
​

DIVIDEND COMPUTATIONS
​

Dividend Formula = [dividend rate] X [average monthly balance]
​

1. Excel file for Monthly, Annual & Lump Sum Scenarios
2. Another take on deposits and dividends formula
​

3. Dividend Computation Examples
SAMPLE 1: (image version):

Contribution: Php 10,000 from July to December 2017
Total Contribution in 2017: Php 60,000
Dividend Rate in 2017: 8.11%
Dividend: ~Php 1,400
YEAREND BALANCE CONCEPT for computing annual dividends:

Balance Each Month

July = Php 10,000
August = Php 20,000
September = Php 30,000
October = Php 40,000
November = Php 50,000
December = Php 60,000
​

Dividend = (dividend rate) X [ (summation of monthly totals) / 12 ]

DIV = 0.0811 dividend rate X [ (Php 10,000 + Php 20,000 + Php 30,000 + Php 40,000 + Php 50,000 + Php 60,000) / 12 months ]

    = 0.0811 X [ Php 210,000 / 12 ]

    = 0.0811 X Php 17,500 

    = PHP 1,419.25
​

SAMPLE 2:

Another sample scenario for uneven deposits:

Contribution: June-Oct = 5K/month, Nov-Dec = 30K/month

Total Contribution Each Month

June = Php 5,000
July = Php 5,000
August = Php 5,000
September = Php 5,000
October = Php 5,000
November = Php 35,000
December = Php 35,000
​

Dividend = (dividend rate) x [ (sum of monthly totals) / 12 months ]

DIV = (7.23%)* x [ Php 95,000 / 12 ]

DIV = PHP 572.375
     *2019 rate
​

Above computations is only for a single year dividend

SAMPLE 3:

Uniform deposits on the complete span of 5 years @ 3K monthly contribution on 8% interest, will give you a little higher than 40K. You may use this compound calculator.

By typing these inputs, you should get something like this

Passive Income/Fixed Income Guide
Go back to FAQ main page

Passive Income/Fixed Income Guide
Passive income is generated by investing in instruments which provide a fixed interest rate and schedule. Usually with these instruments, minimal to almost no action is needed from the investor to realise these gains once the investment is done. Some more passive income investment would include (I'll try to add more details regarding each):

bonds (both corporate and sovereign)

LTNCDs

time deposits

preferred stocks

mutual funds (there are some which distribute dividends)

These instruments generally would have a lower rate of return than other instruments. This is offset by gains being predictable. I would recommend the following though:

invest in multiple instruments. basically diversify your portfolio

invest in multiple companies. some companies like SMC have both bonds and preferred stocks. No matter how stable the company may be, you should protect yourself from the company going under.

stagger your maturity dates. most of these instruments has a set maturity. the investment would end and the company generally give you your money back. its tricky to look for a new investment option to reserve your dividend stream once one matures.

On top of these investment vehicles, you may also look at following:

loans, a bit tricky since income depends on the loanee paying you off. There are online platforms with this in mind, but there are risks involved.

business. You have to be hands on at the start, but once the business is running smoothly and you have a system in place, you can hire people to run it and just monitor the business. This of course also depends on the business/industry its in.

rental property. Ideally to be run as a business. Even once the property is setup you need to market to find renters, negotiate with them and manage any problems that arises. Maintenance of the property is also required during and in between leases.

What are Stocks?
ELI5 for stocks
Additional Info Regarding Stocks
General recommendation
Go back to FAQ main page

Go back to Passive Income Options

What are Stocks?
Stocks or shares are representation of ownership of a company. When a new corporation is created, investors pool their money to setup the corporation's starting capital. Based on the agreement of the incorporators, they are given shares/stocks based on the amount of money they put in. For example, an investor who puts in 50% of the starting capital would be given 50% of the shares/stock and thus own 50% of the company. His shares may be traded and sold to other people as he deems.

ELI5 for stocks
Buying shares (stocks) of a company will make you a part owner of that company. This PSE primer (pdf) contains a step-by-step guide on how to buy stocks.
Yeah, you can buy shares of just one company, but it's better to buy in different sectors (property, mining/oil, industrial, financials, etc) to diversify.

The PSEi is a group of 30 companies in the Philippine Stock Exchange carefully selected to represent the market. It includes SM, SMPH, Ayala Corp, Ayala Land, BPI, BDO among others.

Instead of buying shares of each of those 30 companies, you can just buy an equity index fund, which is a mirror image of the PSEi. There are many equity index funds out there and they differ in management fees, minimum investment cost, etc, but they all aim to do one thing --- to imitate the performance of the PSEi. This thread compares the different equity index funds. FMETF is the best because it has the lowest management fees.

Stocks have corresponding fees: 0.295% for Buy, and 0.895% for Sell transactions (assuming your investment is 8k or higher). See the breakdown here.

As you go lower than 8k, the fee % increases.

Buy Transactions

Transaction	Investment (pesos)	Fees (pesos)	Fee %
Buy	10,000	29.50	0.295%
Buy	9,000	26.55	0.295%
Buy	8,000	23.60	0.295%
Buy	7,000	23.45	0.335%
Buy	6,000	23.30	0.388%
Buy	5,000	23.15	0.463%
Buy	4,000	23.00	0.575%
Buy	3,000	22.85	0.762%
Buy	2,000	22.70	1.135%
Buy	1,000	22.55	2.255%
Sell Transactions

Transaction	Investment (pesos)	Fees (pesos)	Fee %
Sell	10,000	89.50	0.895%
Sell	9,000	80.55	0.895%
Sell	8,000	71.60	0.895%
Sell	7,000	65.45	0.935%
Sell	6,000	59.30	0.988%
Sell	5,000	53.15	1.063%
Sell	4,000	47.00	1.175%
Sell	3,000	40.85	1.362%
Sell	2,000	34.70	1.735%
Sell	1,000	28.55	2.855%
So please always buy or sell at least 8k worth of stocks.

Investing in the PSEi through FMETF
Go back to FAQ main page

Investing in the PSEi through FMETF
FMETF tracks the PSE index. Here's the PSEi graph since year 2000. I described it a little bit in this ELI5 here.

When is the right time to buy?

I prefer not to time the market, so I buy it every month. This is called peso cost averaging.
My previous strategy was to buy whenever the P/E ratio is less than 21, and then sell when the P/E ratio is >22.
Check this PSEi vs PER graph.
But then I realized that if you sell everything at P/E = 22, it would take a long time of buying at P/E < 21 to get back to the same level of exposure.
So I just buy every month. No hassle. No worries.
How long should you hold it?

I looked at the PSEi data since year 2000, because this is the oldest data that I could get my hands on.
Then I looked at each 3-year period (Jan-1-2000 to Jan-1-2003, Jan-2-2000 to Jan-2-2003, ... until Jan-24-2016 to Jan-24-2019). And I calculated the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for each of these periods.
3-year periods have an average CAGR of 12.1%, and a median CAGR of 11.9%, but also saw a period with -22.3% CAGR from Jan-3-2000 to Jan-3-2003.
Then I did the same for 5-year, 7-year, 10-year, and 15-year periods.
Here's the summary:

3-yr CAGR	5-yr CAGR	7-yr CAGR	10-yr CAGR	15-yr CAGR
min	-22.3%	-3.0%	3.0%	3.2%	8.4%
max	41.8%	30.8%	22.2%	21.5%	15.5%
average	12.1%	13.1%	13.3%	13.0%	12.1%
median	11.9%	11.6%	13.6%	13.2%	11.9%
A 3-year investment horizon is too short, as shown by the -22.3% CAGR.
A 5-year investment horizon is still too short. There was a negative CAGR of -3% from Jan 2000 to Jan 2005.
If you increase your horizon to 7 years, you'd probably avoid that negative growth.
So 7 years should be the minimum investment horizon for the PSEi. I personally plan to hold it until it's time to pass to my son as inheritance.
TL/DR: Buy FMETF now, and buy it regularly. And hold for at least 7 years.

Aiming for F.I.R.E?
Starting Points
Savings Rate Impact
Useful Tools
Friendly Reminder
TLDR
Go back to FAQ main page

Aiming for F.I.R.E?
Financial Independence / Retire Early is possible in the Philippines (as any other country). Here is the link of my post/discussion last June 2019 as I share the important things to consider (F.I.R.E. Starting Points). It is also summarized below, excluding details of my personal leanFIRE journey.

F.I.R.E. in it's simplicity is just embracing a debt-free, frugal lifestyle by having 25X worth of annual expenses and living with the capital earnings for life, without the stress of having to work just to pay the bills. There is more to that summary but I'll opt to add links within the post (because there are more qualified people to explain it to you than me). There are also a lot of debates on this topic but I am following this path with my own reasons. I suggest you do due diligence and figure out if this will also work for you. Watch this youtube video before you proceed.

Starting Points
Know the basic of personal finance. Before you follow F.I.R.E., you should atleast be aware of the big ideas of personal finance / financial independence. Make sure you know your expenses, have eliminated most of your debts if there is any, and is willing to reduce your expenses to increase your savings. See the sub's wiki guide for young professionals.

Income doesn't matter, savings rate does. Instead of monthly net/gross comparison, ask how much is the savings rate? Don't be discourage because someone posted saving 20k/mo. If that particular person is earning 100k/mo, then he/she will be ready to retire after 37yrs @20% saving rate. On the other hand say someone is saving 15K/mo on 25K/mo earning, saving rate is 60% and retirement is only after 12.5 years. For more info about the assumptions used, see shockingly simple math behind early retirement by MMM. ​

Set milestone according to your annual net. The popular trend is saving 1M, I'm not saying this is wrong - just not for everyone. For the following example I am only considering savings here without investment to simplify the comparison. (A) If your earning 20k/mo with 50% saving rate, this will be an 8yrs+ journey. (B) While for someone earning 50k/mo with also a 50% saving rate, it will only take 3yrs+. Don't you agree 1M will be overwhelming for (A)? Sometimes maybe even discouraging. Why not choose your own milestone? I suggest for (A) 250k and for (B) 650K, these are their annual income respectively (roughly estimated with 13th mo. bonus, excluding other allowances and incentives). Gauge your milestone with your own income capacity. ​

Savings will not bring you FI, investment will do. This one is a no brainer but I wanted to include since I am seeing a lot of savings only post. After inflation, your money will decrease its value over time if you just leave it on your savings account. Investment will save your funds buying power and even offer higher rate if you just choose the right option for your need. Play with this fire calculator to crunch your own numbers OR see the sub's FI/RE tools on the section further down.

Post/Comment Takeaways:

Savings rate will only help if all those are invested on your retirement fund.
One can FIRE faster by increasing income through side hustles.
Avoid lifestyle creep - while your income may increase in the future, maintain your current level of expenses.
The Trinity Study (also known as the 4% rule) conducted decades ago suggest that if you only withdraw that percentage per annum from your nest egg, you will never run out of money no matter how long you'll live for retirement. Some argue for 3% as the new safe withdrawal or equivalent to having 33X your annual expenses instead. But minimalist/frugalist still believes with 4%.
*There are fatFIRE, FIRE and leanFIRE branches visit the original post for further reading links.

Savings Rate Impact
In below post, my argument is simple.

Savings rate is more important than asset allocation and investment return .

Check my post for the explanation (Dec2019 Update)

​

SR (%) = [ (net income* - expenses) / net income* ] x 100

SR (%) = (investment / net income* ) x 100

*after tax
Useful Tools
FIRE Calculator for planning your own numbers.

Investment Cheatsheet for your portfolio allocation, considering individual's own risk appetite and approximate return rate of known vehicles.

Friendly Reminder
Don't misunderstood the idea. FI/RE isn't about "not working" BUT the flexibility to do anything beside the typical path of paid employment (working until 60 y/o). If you love your job, good for you. But many people are just working for money. FI/RE is living the life you want during your prime years. It's about time, not money.

TLDR
The FI/RE concept means saving a minimum of 25X your annual expenses and fast! Faster than most because of savings rate as high as 80%. With this approach, FI/RE aspirants do really retire early. Like really early.. some in their early 30s while majority of the FIRErs achieve their target NW in their 40s. In FI/RE, one will accumulate wealth for himself/herself. Let's not confuse using the term by saying, someone FIREd by depending on children's subsidy or parent's wealth. Drop the RE part whenever we speak of retirement in that context better to use just FI.

Beware of VULs!
VUL vs BTID vs Self-insurance
Go back to FAQ main page

Beware of VULs!
VULs (variable unit life insurance) combine insurance and investment together. Here are previous threads with VUL agents (thread 1, thread 2, thread 3).

Yes, insurance is good. Yes, investments are good. But combining them would be bad basing on the VULs that I have encountered. You might not even need the insurance component of the VUL because (a.) your workplace already gives you sufficient insurance, and/or (b.) your savings account already comes with free insurance (ex: BPI Save-up or Security Bank All Access), and/or (c.) your net worth is already high enough for you to be able to self-insure. Use this guide to assess if you need insurance in the first place.
For the investment part of the VUL, you are forced to pay them high management fees (> 2%). This is much higher compared with the management fee of FMETF (only 0.5%). And this is one of the reasons why VUL agents get high commission fees (up to 45% of the first year of payment). Read the fine print.
If you really need insurance, get a term insurance (with no investment component). VUL agents might try to tell you that VULs have lower premiums, but that's because part of the insurance charge is coming from the investment component, which is still your money. You're still the one paying for it. Again, read the fine print before you sign anything.

A Student interested in Finance and Investing
Other guides for (work in progress):
Young Professional
Family Man (content to follow)
OFW (content to follow)
Approaching Retirement (content to follow)
This is for you if:
You're currently studying in SHS or college. You still receive an allowance from your parents or a sponsor. You're interested in handling your finances as best as you could.

For working students some concepts here might apply to you, but you might want to look at the young professional guide, as additional reading material.

This guide borders into life advice but please approach it in the context of financial advice.

Invest in your future career
The best way for you to invest right now is to invest in your future career, and that means investing in your education. I know this sounds cliche as hell but as a student it's the most impactful thing you can do for your future.

Whether you want to have a corporate job, to work in the government, or even to be an entrepreneur, your education is a big factor in getting where you want to be.

You can head on over to r/phcareers for an idea on what to expect. They regularly talk about different industries and general career topics there.

Education
Major
You need to have a good idea of what you want to do or at least a feeling of what field you'd want to be in. Don't be too focused on the pay (i.e. Don't go into IT just because it pays well), but don't disregard it entirely either. There needs to be some practicality in this decision between the possible payoff and how much you enjoy what you're doing. Keep in mind that your career will last decades and you need to be comfortable possibly doing that your whole life.

School
When you decide on a school, try to base it on the course you want to take. Some schools have specialties that they're known for, while some courses you'd be fine with any school. CHED publishes its list of centers of excellence (COE) for specific disciplines.

Take into consideration the price of the school. If the price is out of reach, look into scholarships both from the school or offered by third parties. Your school of choice can point you to the right direction.

Extracurricular
Aside from academics, college is the best time to join organizations and to participate in events. More than a resume filler, these provide you with good training in organizing events, collaborating, and socializing.

Most courses have organizations for them. Consider joining these as a way to expand your professional network, they can give you access to the industry and provide possible employment opportunities.

There are also a lot of organizations focused on specific interests or advocacies. Try them out and have some fun.

Lifestyle
College is a time when you start to develop and enforce financial habits, both the good and the bad. The idea is that you take charge and steer into developing good financial habits.

Start with budgeting and tracking your expenses, there's more info on this on the next guide. Getting this habit early can save you years of regret trying to piece together where your money went.

Avoid keeping up with the joneses. Don't buy stuff you can't afford because of peer pressure. If you fall into this, it's going to be a slippery slope even into your adulthood.

Finance and Investment
The closest thing to finance and investment you should be worried about right now is having your own bank account. Assuming you're 18 it's time to open your own account separate from your parents.

When looking into your first bank consider the required initial deposit, minimum average daily balance requirement, and annual fees, if any. Ideally these should be as low as possible, some banks offer 0 maintaining but oftentimes this comes at the expense of annual fees. If you can afford to maintain the minimum balance, these accounts usually don't have annual fees but penalize you if you go below maintaining. Some banks offer minimum balance of 3,000 to 5,000 which should be maintainable for students.

For most traditional banks, interest rate is low enough to be negligible. You can also look into digital banks (CIMB & ING) which offer higher interest rates. I suggest maintaining some spending money with a traditional bank though. Once you have extra funds you can start to consider earning from interest.

This is your practice in saving money. If you're able to save enough, try building an emergency fund (I'll discuss this more in the next guide). Although you're likely to still be taken care of by your parents, building this early on can save you headaches in the future. Right now, you can also consider this as an opportunity fund. Imagine the following scenarios:

You're invited to an out of town seminar but you'll need to shell out money, opportunity fund
You're interested in graphic arts as a hobby/side gig and you need a tablet, opportunity fund
Having money available can save you so much headache, as well as provide opportunities you otherwise wouldn't have been able to afford.

For more discussion on saving money and the frugal mindset, you can go to r/phmoneysaving.

Closing
You may have noticed that I barely talked about investing in this guide. In my point of view ensuring the best possible start to your career and developing the right mindset with money is the best investment a student can do, and this is something that can't be done by investing in a financial instrument.

If your circumstances have provided you with a substantial amount that you can invest or maybe you have a job/gig that pays well, you can go ahead on to the next guide to look at the next steps in your financial journey.

Approaching Retirement (content to follow)
This is for you if:
You're finished with SHS/vocational/undergrad course. You're in the first 5 years of your professional career. You might still be living with your parents or starting to live independently. You don't have your own family yet, which means no child to support. But, you might be contributing to your parents or your siblings.

Where to begin:
After all those years of education, you're finally earning, congratulations! Pat your self on the back. Now that you have money you need to know how to handle it.

Track your expenses
This sounds simple but I find that people don't actually do this. To be financially responsible you need to start by knowing where your money goes. Track your spend. You can use an app or manually do it on a spreadsheet (I prefer apps because of accessibility, some apps allow exporting as a spreadsheet for in-depth analysis). I personally use expense manager on android.

Here's a list of app recommendations from the community:

iOS
iFinance
Android
Bluecoins
Expense Manager
iOS & Android
Money Manager | Guide Post / Features Tip
Spendee
Dollarbird
Fudget
Money Lover
The first 3 months you do this I suggest you track everything to the peso. You might not realize how these things build up.

Manage Expenses
After a few months of tracking your expenses you should already have a view of where your money goes. You need to identify the major categories you're spending on (food, entertainment, rent, transportation, phone bill, etc). Most apps already have prebuilt categories and ask you to tag your expenses.

Ask yourself if you're happy with how much you're spending on each category. This is when you start to realize you're spending more than you wanted on food, for example, because of your usual starbucks or milk tea order. Start looking for alternatives for these things. For example:

Coffee: start brewing your own, look up coldbrew or get a french press. The price of a cup in starbucks can get you a weeks worth of beans for your own coffee.
Lunch Outs: consider bringing packed lunch instead, this significantly lowers your expenses if you can meal prep for the whole week.
Maybe you see that you're spending too much on your hobbies. Ask yourself if it's worth it, there are hobbies you can consider that don't require too much spend and there are even hobbies you can monetize and turn to a side gig as well. If you truly enjoy the hobby, you can try to allocate a fixed amount of your income to it and spend no more than that. I often see people allocate 10% for this.

You'll also have expenses that will be difficult to change immediately (rent, phone plan, etc). These things will take time to control, but knowing them now will help you plan better in the future. For your rent assess if what you're getting is just right for you. If you feel that it's high try looking at other places once its time to renew, consider down sizing or a roommate if you can. For your phone plan you might be paying more than what you need, reassess your usage and if a lower tier plan can meet them.

Hopefully after assessing your spending and making changes, you can lower your expenses and start increasing your savings. Even after this continue to monitor and track your expenses to make sure that they're still under control.

Emergency Fund
Now that you're saving money you can start building your emergency fund. So what is an emergency fund? This will be the money you'll use on emergencies, hence emergency fund. So what kind of emergencies?

You got fired and need to pay for your rent & bills while looking for a job, emergency fund.
You or a family member gets hospitalized and you need money, emergency fund.
Your paycheck is late, emergency fund.
A pandemic hits and you can't work or your business is closed, emergency fund.
A normal suggestion is to have an emergency fund worth at least 3 times your monthly expenses. Read expenses, which means that you can live with that fund for at least 3 months! But with the current situation some people started to suggest 6 months to a year. In numbers, if you're spending PHP25,000 per month, you need PHP75,000 for a 3 month emergency fund.

Your emergency fund needs to be liquid, which means it needs to be easily accessible in a day's notice. A savings account or a time deposit is sufficient for this.

This doesn't mean you need to settle on the low interest traditional banks have though, you can place them on high interest accounts like ING & CIMB. If you do that, make sure you still have some cash on a traditional bank though, transferring out of CIMB & ING isn't instant and it might be difficult to get the funds for regular spending.

Now some of you might think to invest this emergency fund, please resist the urge. When an emergency like a market crash happens your fund will lose value and might not be enough to provide for your needs. Don't invest your emergency fund.

Other people are lucky enough to have financial fallbacks in the form of financially capable parents. Although you can rely on them to provide your needs, part of growing financially is being able to take care of yourself. So again, build that emergency fund.

Here's the wiki resource for more information

Invest
You've tracked and managed your expenses, you've built your emergency fund, and now you have extra money. It's now time to invest. This will be your ticket to actually growing your money. All the steps before was just hygiene.

In order to invest you need to evaluate your GOALS & TIMELINE, and your RISK APPETITE. Why is this important? This makes sure your investments is in line with what you want and that you're okay with your investment when things go wrong.

Once you identify these, you can start to look at the investments that can make them happen. Here's a few examples:

Build a house in 5 years: You'll want an investment where your principal is protected but allows you to still grow your money.

Government bonds are relatively low risk investments. These are usually offered by the government through banks, you'll need to consult your bank for when they are available. Virtually no risk of government not paying. Look into Bonds.ph or BTR website
Corporate bonds are riskier than government bonds but offer better interest to compensate. Carries risk of the issuer defaulting/going bankrupt.
Finance childbirth in 9 months: You're preparing money for childbirth but want to grow it in the meantime.

High Interest Savings Account gives interest while making sure that you have access to the funds when needed.
Time Deposit a 1 month time deposit rollover will work, but take into account that when near the 9th month you might need to terminate it earlier.
Retire in 20 years: You want to retire early and want as much return from your funds as possible. You don't need the money anytime soon and seeing it in a sea of red doesn't bother you.

Index Funds there's been a lot of talk on what kind of fund is best. It's been the community consensus to invest in an Index fund. When looking for an index fund you want the lowest fees possible. Right that is through FMETF. Do the cost averaging method and religiously invest every month/quarter.
Foreign Funds as an alternative you can also invest in funds of other countries. Usual recommendation is for the US given its reputation as the world's top economy. In the Philippines you have feeder funds that invest in the US index: Sec Bank & BPI (also offers peso denominated fund)
MP2 is a voluntary savings program by PAGIBIG. It offers annual interest returns while your principal is government secured. Your fund will be locked in for the entire period but this isn't a problem for your timeline. Read more here
Here's the investment cheatsheet from the FAQ

??? Phase
You need to diligently keep applying all the previous steps. Monitor your expenses, control you spend, ensure your emergency fund is sufficient, and keep investing.

In the previous steps we've talked about controlling expenses and investing. That's because our expenses is something we have immediate control over. But our savings is a function of income - expenses. In this phase you can start looking at how to improve your income.

Reinvest in yourself, get new skills and complete certifications you can use to ask for a better salary. Maybe even monetize a skill/hobby you have.

Make sure to control life style creep, when you get a promotion or a raise make sure to save some for investing. The higher your savings rate the sooner you get to retire. READ THIS FOR THE MAGIC OF SAVINGS RATE

But remember, don't be obsessed with the money, money works for you and not the other way around. Don't sacrifice your wellbeing for the sake of saving money. Take the time to enjoy yourself as well. Treat yo'self bish

Here's the long part of journey. You might have done everything before this in under a year but after this, it's going to be a long time till the next phase. Make sure to stay the course and live your life.

Setting a Retirement Goal
To consider retirement you need to know your magic number. I suggest looking at FIRE for those who want to learn more about this. But a quick rundown is that you need at least 25 times your annual expense invested in order to live off investments without having to work.

If you spend PHP1,000,000 per year you need at least PHP25,000,000.

To improve the speed you achieve FIRE savings rate is the ultimate tool. HERE'S ANOTHER TAKE ON SAVINGS RATE. Higher income + lower expenses = higher savings rate.

The numbers around FIRE is currently based in the US so you need to consider that in your assumptions.

Here's the wiki resource for FIRE

Kickoff of r/phinvest Personal Finance Guide Project! Topic 1: Do You Need Insurance?
Insurance
Hello everyone!

The PF-Guide team assembled in the phinvest discord server to create a decision map for several personal finance areas, first of which is one of the most discussed and most controversial topics in phinvest: Life Insurance.

This project hatched from u/Octobrew's comment here, and acted upon by u/dgxxiii and initiated by u/ninja4lyf. A lot of people on the server pitched in their share, from proofreading and accessibility to logical flow and future possibilities - you know yourselves. A big thank you to you all!

You can find the link to the full-sized map in our FAQs, and below is a preview:

r/phinvest - Kickoff of r/phinvest Personal Finance Guide Project! Topic 1: Do You Need Insurance?
Please visit our FAQs for the full-sized version.

This map is a culmination of comments, posts and random discussions in r/phinvest and in the discord server about insurance. This is not necessarily a one and done thing, we are open to comments and suggestions and we'll try our best to incorporate your ideas!

EDIT1: We've made some changes in the chart based on inputs from u/lebron2zorros and u/davemacho. Special thanks to @~LoafieBear from discord for the watermark and logo!

EDIT2: u/that_omashu_merchant created a wonderful interactive version of the chart here. Please check it out!

With that out of the way, we'd like to conduct a poll to gauge interest for the next topic that will be covered by the PF-Guide. We won't necessarily create one for the winner, because we may not have enough knowledgeable contributors (looking at you Forex).

Which topic below are you interested in seeing a guide similar to the one above? Please share in the comments why, as well as your expectations for the topic of your choice!

Great point! The idea behind was that parents generally should not be dependent on you, but we will take this into account and add relatives/loved ones to the "Do I have children?" box. Thank you!

Excellent and very well done guys, salamat!

Let’s do flowchart on investing too. Lots of newbies keep asking,

“mababa na ba ang presyo, time to buy na ba?”

“kung long term ako bibili na ba ako?”

“ok po ba if i buy (insert shell company with no business activities yet pretending to be an operational company) now anyway long term pa naman ako”

“Ok po ba magpasok lang ako ng XXX amount sa FMETF or MP2 every month for my retirement po?”

If someone is in his early 20s with no dependent, do you advise against getting whole life insurance to take advantage of lower premium rates?

While it is not a priority, there is value in getting a policy at a young age for future use, benefiting his dependents during his 30s/40s, and also allowing him to save on cost of premium. What do you think?

Yes, davemacho, this is a plausible option! In general, whole life insurance premiums will be more expensive than term from the get-go (even if you are still in your 20s, and it will be "cheaper" only after a certain age), so if you can afford those premiums, the map does point you to whole insurance.

EDIT: Oh wait, I misunderstood. You mean if you do not have dependents? We'll discuss this as this is quite a point of contention.

u/davemacho 2 points for me:

Will your ending net worth (estate planning for future dependents) be big enough to choose whole life over term?

Are you an employee? or a businessman?

If your the former then you plan to stay longterm in a company that offers group insurance, you might not need insurance for estate planning (term, VUL, whole life)

Ending net worth is uncertain at an early age. And someone in his 20s may start as an employee then put up a business later on. Is it a good choice not to get whole life insurance at all since the future is uncertain and he has no dependent yet? Just opening this up for discussion.

I'm in my 30s now, got a VUL policy in my 20s, and just added a term policy recently as my net worth increased. I'm thinking if it might have been better if I just got a whole life policy in my 20s with a larger redemption value and lower premium cost.

Do you even factor in projected/future net worth and dependents' expenses when making a decision to get an insurance, or just decide based on present circumstances and add policies with sufficient value later on?

Yes it means net worth now to determine if you need protection. If you currently have the target coverage of atleast 5% from your NW - you can opt to self-insure. Otherwise follow the line.

Net Worth is what you own minus what you owe.

Insurance coverage is different for everyone, that depends on the coverage needed by your dependent(s) in an unlikely event you die. Usually they should be left with atleast 3 years worth of expenses.

To add, 5% is a fairly arbitrary choice. One question you need to ask yourself is, "Am I comfortable losing x% of my net worth in case I get sick?" If you are comfortable with losing 50% of your wealth to pay for your hospital bills, you do you. 5% is chosen because for those starting to build their wealth, you should only be allotting at most 5% of your income to insurance premiums.

Thank you guys! I found this very helpful! I'm in a job right now with a very good HMO but I've been playing with the idea of moving to a lower-paying job with even less HMO coverage (for skill building) and then just back on my insurance. The flowchart gave me a categorical answer on the importance of my HMO in that decision. Cheers!

I believe this is a pretty niche circumstance to be included in a general guide, but to answer your question, you can still follow the guide, but you need to consider additional things:

For HMO, choose an annual coverage. This should be pretty easy, as most HMO are annual by nature.

For Critical Illness, you need to look for a policy that will cover you even if you already live abroad (ask your agent about this).

Alternatively, if you are still quite young by the time you migrate (say, in your early 30s), you can choose to get your CI insurance abroad. Depending on the country you migrate in, they may have better deals for you over there. However, if you are older than 35, there's a high chance it would be very expensive, in which case you should probably do #2 instead.

For Life insurance, same as #2 or #3. Another option is to get term insurance for 5-10 years, if you project that by that time you're out of the country.

As you can see this is a pretty complex decision, and depends on a lot of things. Will your beneficiaries stay in the country or will you take them? What kind of country are you going to migrate in? How's their healthcare, etc.

As an additional note, this is why you need to look for an agent that is knowledgeable and not just in it for your money. They should be able to answer these questions for you, on a personalized basis. Their job is to take care of your insurance needs.

Actually the flowchart continues after you stop at health insurance/HMO/CI. What are your results on the life insurance portion?

I presume you're single with no dependents. Cancelling your insurance depends on a lot of factors. How much is your coverage, how many years you are paying, how much of your income goes to the premiums, your future plans, etc.

My general advice for switching/cancellation insurance is as follows (I'm going to assume that your life insurance is a VUL):

If you have no HMO/health insurance of any form, prioritize getting one first.

Compute how much of your net income (salaries less taxes) goes to both the life insurance and health insurance premiums. If it's above 10%, I suggest you give up the life insurance since you don't need it now, and it eats up way too much of your income that you'd rather save or invest.

If your income is high enough that the life insurance premiums are a minimal expense for you:

You have the choice to keep it, especially if you've been paying it for a long time (the charges are all paid up). Same goes if you know nothing about investments.

If you are planning to have dependents in the near future (3 or so years?), then you might end up needing an insurance anyway. You need to crunch some numbers and see if you'd be better off paying that insurance for the rest of the payment period (with occasional top-ups), or if you do BTID.

Unfortunately, each case is unique, so I can't give you any more tips beyond this.

I'm in my 20s and have 1 dependent. Seeing the flow chart asking if I have HMO (which I don't) before opting for insurance makes me think I shouldn't get insurance yet? I've been offered whole life insurance from Prulife for 2.5k/month with 1.5M death benefit, CI or Accident/Disability rider benefits as well. Should I consider getting an HMO before diving into life insurance?

How about an alternate route/suggestions for people from “Do I have co-signed loans —> Life insurance may not be a priority for now”. I mean, if it’s not a priority right now, what else should we do or invest in at the moment?

Hi! Well first of all, life insurance is not an "investment" in the traditional sense, it's for income protection. This flowchart is to find out whether your current situation requires you to get income protection, and if so, what type of insurance (term, whole, VUL) would be suited for you. If you ended up in "life insurance may not be a priority" then clearly you can divert your funds to other investments (mutual funds, bonds, stocks, etc.) but that is out of scope for this activity.

Hi. Why aren't combined life and health insurance policies not have a mention here? Are those actually bad? If so, why?

They actually are. "Health Insurance" and "Critical Insurance" usually have life insurance bundled with them. You'll have a harder time finding stand-alone products for those than bundled ones. As to whether they're good or bad, that would depend on your needs. It's different from person to person.

Emergency Funds
Go back to FAQ main page

Emergency Funds
What is it?

Simply put, it's money stowed away for emergency use.

What kind of emergencies?

Emergencies are the ones you are not expecting to happen but need immediate attention. This does not include Flash Lazada Sales, Piso Fares, and expenses that you should have been saving for in the first place before it is due (e.g. kid's tuition, Meralco, wedding).

Why do I need it?

Any good financial book or advisor would always tell you that when you start investing the very first thing* you need to do is to build up your emergency fund. This is because having a buffer for unexpected events in your life frees you from debt, worry and ensures that you could follow your financial plans to a T.

I'm ready, how much should I save? Is there a magic number?

The amount you need to put away is a case to case basis. Some save from 3 months' worth of salary, others could do 6 or even for a whole year. The premise is that if you find yourself jobless for x months you don't need to depend on anybody's charity to get by. Just be realistic on your planned amount and time frame and you're good to go.

Don't forget to replenish each time you use it too. Always make it a point that your fund is intact as soon as you can.

I now have the money, where should I put it?

The safest place you could put it is in the bank. It's free and unlike your closet earns a bit of interest. Just put an effort in not withdrawing anything from it and that would be fine.

You can also put it in a low risk 30 Day recurring Time Deposit. Not only does it have better interest rates, it prevents you to withdraw because it is locked for 30 days. You can get it anytime though (this is for emergency after all) but you need to personally meet a bank rep just to transact unlike with an ATM that you only need to dip it on a machine.

But it's a huge amount, shouldn't I invest it instead?

This is a big NO. Emergency funds need to retain their principal amount to be of any value. There is no point in putting it on high risk investments. This is like gambling with your child's college fund hoping that it would double before you need it.

*Technically you need to pay off debts first, especially short ones and with high interest.

-- by u/hermitina

Alternative places where to place your emergency fund

Savings accounts that give you free insurance (BPI Save-up/ BPI Pamana/ Security Bank All Access/ BDO Kabayan/ RCBC Hexagon Club Privilege)
Money market funds (Look at asset type = money market in this list)
High-interest savings accounts (ING/ CIMB)
Combination of 1, 2, 3
Please consider the convenience and time needed to withdraw from your emergency fund when actual emergencies happen. So you may structure your emergency fund depending on how long it takes to withdraw them. An example would be:

2 days worth of expenses to be kept at home
2 weeks worth of expenses to be kept in an ATM savings account
3 to 5.5 months worth of expenses to be kept in a money market fund
This is just an example. You need to plan for it basing on your personal situation.
